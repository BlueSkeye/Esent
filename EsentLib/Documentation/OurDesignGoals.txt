Our design goals are slightly different from MS initial version. Main differences are :

- Seeking for a much more object oriented API. This will break minimal editorialization
  from original goals.
- Targeting Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 as the core platforms. Other platforms
  are not a priority. Framework 4.6.2 will be the main targeted framework. Older versions
  may be workable.
- Metro/Windows Store Apps support is expressely unsupported. Related code is being removed.
